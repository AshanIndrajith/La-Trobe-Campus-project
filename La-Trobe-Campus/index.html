            <h3>Our vision</h3>
            <p class="about-La">The pandemic has shaken the world, and its tremors have extended to Australia's higher education system,
                 including La Trobe. We need to respond comprehensively and positively, ensuring that our actions equip 
                 our university to surmount current difficulties and remain sustainable, valued and relevant as the world 
                 returns to normalcy.  This Plan sets out the Universityâ€™s vision and strategies for the coming ten years.
                 <br><br>

                La Trobe is a university known for making a positive difference in the lives of our students, 
                partners and communities. We will become an even more valued and relevant university because of 
                the way we respond to their needs in this time of great local and national crisis.
                <br><br>
                Our aim is to emerge as a more resilient, future-focused and necessarily more efficient institution 
                that will thrive in a post-COVID world by being more sharply focused on the needs of our community, 
                and by playing to our strengths in teaching and research. The Strategic Plan is a living document 
                that we will review periodically to ensure it remains relevant to our circumstances.

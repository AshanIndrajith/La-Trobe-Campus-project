            <p class="about-right-p">

                The pandemic has shaken the world, and its tremors have extended to Australia's higher education system, 
                including La Trobe. We need to respond comprehensively and positively,
                 ensuring that our actions equip our university to surmount current difficulties and remain sustainable, 
                 valued and relevant as the world returns to normalcy.  This Plan sets out the University’s 
                 vision and strategies for the coming ten years.<br><br>

                La Trobe is a university known for making a positive difference in the lives of our students, 
                partners and communities. We will become an even more valued and relevant university because of the way we 
                respond to their needs in this time of great local and national crisis.<br><br>

                Our aim is to emerge as a more resilient, future-focused and necessarily more efficient institution that 
                will thrive in a post-COVID world by being more sharply focused on the needs of our community, and by playing to
                 our strengths in teaching and research. The Strategic Plan is a living document that we will review periodically 
                 to ensure it remains relevant to our circumstances.
